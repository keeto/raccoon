Raccoon: The Sneaky Little Framework
====================================
Raccoon is a small framework for creating server-side javascript applications, written on top of MooTools and running on v8cgi.

> *Notice:* Raccoon is currently undergoing transition. The current <master> branch is obsolete and is being rewritten. Follow the repo and wait for announcements.

Requirements
------------
Raccoon only has one requirement: you'll need to have a web-server running v8cgi trunk. Because building, installing and running v8cgi is too complex to add here, we direct you to the official [v8cgi homepage](http://code.google.com/p/v8cgi/).


Docs and Samples
